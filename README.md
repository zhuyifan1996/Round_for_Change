## Project name: Make Change
We are building on the highly successful model of crowdfunding. The model as it exists involves individuals seeing a cause, going online and submitting a finite sum. We are attempting to expand that model. We are attempting to create a mobile platform for both individuals and nonprofits that allows users to join their campaign. For the period of time they are involved every purchase they make will be rounded up to the nearest full dollar amount and be sent to the campaign of their choice. This expands on a several concepts already at work across the economy. The first is social good corporations. Companies like Warby-Parker and Toms have built huge companies on the idea that consumerism can be a force for good. We want to make every purchase a quantitative social good. There are millions of individuals looking to create, whether that is recording an album or building a community garden. Americans give more to charity than any nation on earth. We want to give individuals a tool to contribute every day while empowering the people in their social network and the causes they believe in.
